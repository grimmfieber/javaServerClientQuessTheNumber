Basic game that guessing number sent by client.

Just a basic implementation of socket lib. 

>>How does it works?

Server side choosing a random number in range of 1-10 then client side tries guess the choosen number.
As client side guessed a number will send it to server. After then, server will check if number is true or not.
if it's not, server will sent a message to client as increase or decrease.
